<h2>About</h2>

<p>
	My name is Andrew Furze and I am a graduate of the
	Colorado School of Mines in Golden, CO.  I received my 
	bachelors in Computer Science with a minor in Geological
	Engineering in August of 2013
</p>
<p>
	Currently, I am seeking a position in information security, computer security, 
	or network security.  If you know anyone currently seeking people for such a 
	position, please <a href="contact.php">contact me</a>.
</p>
<p>
	I worked as a web development intern for the U.S. Geological Survey
	<a href="http://geomag.usgs.gov">Geomagnetism Program</a> and then 
	for the USGS <a href="http://earthquake.usgs.gov">Earthquake Program</a>.
</p>
<p>
	I attended meetings of the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/OWASP-Boulder/">
	Boulder OWASP chapter</a> where I helped, to whetever extent I could, with
	putting together a CTF for SnowFROC 2013.
</p>
<p>
	Apart from computer science, I am also a big soccer fan.  I played
	for twelve years and was a referee from 2001 to 2013.  I am also looking
	for someone to go mountain biking with, so shoot me an email if your
	interested!
